This project is my first unity 2D Project. 
I have utiilized Eric Van De Kerckhove's tutorial on Introduction to Unity 2D 


In this tutorial, I built a 2D space lander game and learn the following skills along the way:

How to work with sprites and the camera.
How to use Physics 2D components to handle collisions and gameplay.
How to set up 2D animation and states.
How to apply layer and sprite ordering.
